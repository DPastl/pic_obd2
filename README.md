# Introduction
This code is based on the fine work of RichardvdK on Instructables, his [cheap OBD2 scanner](https://www.instructables.com/id/Low-Cost-OBD2-Communications-on-K-line-ISO-9141-2-/) is a fun project you can make with many components you might have lying around.  This was one of the few projects that I've made where it just worked out the box!

This code is my attempt at polishing up the code base and fixing some bugs that I've found.  It may or may not be extended into a separate library at some point.

# Getting Started
You'll need to install MPLabX along with the 8-bit compiler.  Then import this project and you should be good to go.
